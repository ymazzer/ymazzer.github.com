The coding period has begun on 23rd may. Anyway the charge which falls to me due
to university projects and exams is too heavy to work on my GSoC project at full
time. I cloned [fise.client](https://github.com/collective/fise.client) and 
[fise.plone](https://github.com/collective/fise.plone) and began to document it. 
I now understand the code. I will document it to make sure anyone can use the 
library without reading the source.
