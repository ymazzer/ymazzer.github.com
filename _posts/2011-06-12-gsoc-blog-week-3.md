This week, I fixed the bugs I discovered last week due to dependencies updates.
I discussed it with Jens on Tuesday. Actually we did the same work in parallel
because I didn't commited the changes on github. Anyway, the fise.client library
is now running with the latest stanbol head on `/engine` and `/store` entry points.

The stanbol demo sites I used are not the latest head, I decided to deploy my
own instance on my server to run tests against it.
