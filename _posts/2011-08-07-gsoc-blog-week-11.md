This week, I started the integration of webvie in Plone for rdf text
enhancements. Sadly it is not finished yet. I am facing some issues with it
(little bugs I corrected to make it work) in the webvie source, and another more
consequent in the workflow. I contacted Szaby Gr√ºnwald, one of the two
developpers working on webvie, to discuss it with him.

Today, I am doing some cleanup in the stanbol.plone source before my next push.

Next week I will continue the webvie integration and develop entityhub API in
stanbol.client.
