I recently had my first visible results as I explained in [my precedent
article](/2011/07/28/first-visible-results).
Due to issues with my server, my blog was down, and since I got it up and
running this morning, I write my weekly article.

So, the keyword enhancer based on Stanbol engines result is integrated as
described in my previous article. I'm now going to integrate enhancervie to
enhance the text itself. I am not sure that enhancervie is plug and play and I
may have to tweak it a little to integrate it to Plone.

Furthermore, I fixed configuration bug this morning, I have to make final tests
but the stanbol control panel should be now working.
