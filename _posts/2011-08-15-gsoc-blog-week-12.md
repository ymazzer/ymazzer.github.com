This week, I almost finished the webvie integration, as shown in the [previous
post](/2011/08/11/quite-close-). After a discussion with Jens W. Klein, my mentor, we decided to get the
enhancer outside of the form workflow and to have it in the main workflow. The
last thing to do in order to finish is to add the functionnality to save
enhancements. A little screenshot :

Furthermore, I achieved the development of the SparQL console :

So, this week, I will finish little tweaking, to make new features
end-user-proof, write documentation, doctests and integration tests.
